 script serves as a basic conversational agent that interacts with the user through text input in the command line. Its functionalities include:

Opening Google in the default web browser when prompted.
Closing the currently active tab in the default web browser.
Exiting the conversation when the user inputs "exit" or "quit".
To use this script, you can run it in a Python environment. It relies on the webbrowser, platform, and subprocess modules for opening web pages, determining the operating system, and executing system commands, respectively.

To ensure it works perfectly in Visual Studio Code, you would need to make sure you have Python installed and correctly configured. The script should run smoothly as long as there are no issues with the environment setup and dependencies. You can execute it within VSCode's integrated terminal
